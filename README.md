# Golden Rules To One-Shot Projects with AI

## 1. Project Setup
- Define clear project scope and requirements
- Create basic project structure upfront
- Set up version control immediately

## 2. Development Workflow
- Write tests before implementation
- Commit small, focused changes
- Document as you go
- Use meaningful commit messages

## 3. AI Interaction Best Practices
- Ask specific, focused questions
- Break complex tasks into smaller chunks
- Validate AI-generated code
- Always review suggested changes
- Keep context window focused

## 4. Code Quality
- Maintain consistent coding style
- Follow SOLID principles
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use meaningful variable names
- Comment complex logic

## 5. Testing & Documentation
- Write unit tests for core functionality
- Document API endpoints
- Include setup instructions
- Maintain updated README

## 6. Version Control
- Use feature branches
- Regular commits
- Meaningful commit messages
- Pull request reviews

## 7. Error Handling
- Validate user input
- Handle edge cases
- Log errors appropriately
- Provide meaningful error messages

## 8. Security
- Sanitize user input
- Secure API endpoints
- Handle sensitive data carefully
- Regular dependency updates

# Project Goal

# General Instructions
- Use a clear and concise explanation before writing code.
- Request confirmation before making changes.
- Focus on the most important aspect of the prompt first.
- Do the simple thing first, then gradually increase complexity.
- Break down tasks into smaller, manageable steps.

# Code Generation
- Always add unit tests for new features.
- Ensure code is well-commented.
- Prefer modules and functions over single files.
- Don't write duplicate code; look for existing solutions.
- Make requested changes only.
